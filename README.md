# Star Wars Planet Search
---
In this project I developed a filter list of planets from the Star Wars universe using Context API and Hooks to control global states.

This project was created using:

- React's Context API to manage state.
- React Hooks useState, useContext, and useEffect.
- React Testing Library.
- CSS
